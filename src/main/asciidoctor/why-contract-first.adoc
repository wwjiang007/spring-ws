= Why Contract First?

When creating web services, there are two development styles: contract-last and contract-first. When you use a contract-last approach, you start with the Java code and let the web service contract (in WSDL -- see sidebar) be generated from that. When using contract-first, you start with the WSDL contract and use Java to implement the contract.

****
*What is WSDL?*

WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language. A WSDL file is an XML document that describes a web service. It specifies the location of the service and the operations (or methods) the service exposes. For more information about WSDL, see the https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl[WSDL specification].

Spring-WS supports only the contract-first development style, and this section explains why.

== Object/XML Impedance Mismatch

Similar to the field of ORM, where we have an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_impedance_mismatch[Object/Relational impedance mismatch], converting Java objects to XML has a similar problem. At first glance, the O/X mapping problem appears simple: Create an XML element for each Java object to convert all Java properties and fields to sub-elements or attributes. However, things are not as  simple as they appear, because there is a fundamental difference between hierarchical languages, such as XML (and especially XSD), and the graph model of Java.

NOTE: Most of the contents in this section were inspired by <<alpine>> and <<effective-enterprise-java>>.

=== XSD Extensions

In Java, the only way to change the behavior of a class is to subclass it to add the new behavior to that subclass. In XSD, you can extend a data type by restricting it -- that is, constraining the valid values for the elements and attributes. For instance, consider the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<simpleType name="AirportCode">
  <restriction base="string">
      <pattern value="[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]"/>
  </restriction>
</simpleType>
----

This type restricts a XSD string by way of a regular expression, allowing only three upper case letters. If this type is converted to Java, we end up with an ordinary  `java.lang.String`. The regular expression is lost in the conversion process, because Java does not allow for these sorts of extensions.

=== Unportable Types

One of the most important goals of a web service is to be interoperable: to support multiple platforms such as Java, .NET, Python, and others. Because all of these languages have different class libraries, you must use some common, cross-language format to communicate between them. That format is XML, which is supported by all of these languages.

Because of this conversion, you must make sure that you use portable types in your service implementation. Consider, for example, a service that returns a  `java.util.TreeMap`:

====
[source,java]
----
public Map getFlights() {
  // use a tree map, to make sure it's sorted
  TreeMap map = new TreeMap();
  map.put("KL1117", "Stockholm");
  ...
  return map;
}
----
====

Undoubtedly, the contents of this map can be converted into some sort of XML, but since there is no standard way to describe a map in XML, it will be proprietary. Also, even if it can be converted to XML, many platforms do not have a data structure  similar to the `TreeMap`. So when a .NET client accesses your web service, it probably ends up with a `System.Collections.Hashtable`, which has different semantics.

This problem is also present when working on the client side. Consider the following XSD snippet, which describes a service contract:

====
[source,xml]
----
<element name="GetFlightsRequest">
  <complexType>
    <all>
      <element name="departureDate" type="date"/>
      <element name="from" type="string"/>
      <element name="to" type="string"/>
    </all>
  </complexType>
</element>
----
====

This contract defines a request that takes an `date`, which is a XSD datatype representing a year, month, and day. If we call this service from Java, we probably use  either a `java.util.Date` or `java.util.Calendar`. However, both of these classes actually describe times, rather than dates. So, we actually end up sending data that represents the fourth of April 2007 at midnight (`2007-04-04T00:00:00`), which is not the same as `2007-04-04`.

=== Cyclic Graphs

Imagine we have the following class structure:

====
[source,java]
----
public class Flight {
  private String number;
  private List<Passenger> passengers;

  // getters and setters omitted
}

public class Passenger {
  private String name;
  private Flight flight;

  // getters and setters omitted
}
----
====

This is a cyclic graph: the `Flight` refers to the `Passenger`, which refers to the `Flight` again. Cyclic graphs like these are quite common in Java. If we take a naive approach to converting this to XML, we end up with something  like:

====
[source,xml]
----
<flight number="KL1117">
  <passengers>
    <passenger>
      <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
      <flight number="KL1117">
        <passengers>
          <passenger>
            <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
            <flight number="KL1117">
              <passengers>
                <passenger>
                   <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
                   ...
----
====

Processing such a structure is likely to take a long time to finish, because there is no stop condition for this loop.

One way to solve this problem is to use references to objects that were already marshalled:

====
[source,xml]
----
<flight number="KL1117">
  <passengers>
    <passenger>
      <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
      <flight href="KL1117" />
    </passenger>
    ...
  </passengers>
</flight>
----
====

This solves the recursion problem but introduces new ones. For one, you cannot use an XML validator to validate this structure. Another issue is that the standard way to use these references in SOAP (RPC/encoded) has been deprecated in favor of document/literal (see the WS-I http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html#SOAP_encodingStyle_Attribute[Basic Profile]).

These are just a few of the problems when dealing with O/X mapping. It is important to respect these issues when writing web services. The best way to respect them is to focus on the XML completely, while using Java as an implementation language. This is what contract-first is all about.

== Contract-first Versus Contract-last

Besides the Object/XML Mapping issues mentioned in the previous section, there are other reasons for preferring a contract-first development style.

* <<contract-first-fragility>>
* <<contract-first-performance>>
* <<contract-first-reusability>>
* <<contract-first-versioning>>

[[contract-first-fragility]]
=== Fragility

As mentioned earlier, the contract-last development style results in your web service contract (WSDL and your XSD) being generated from your Java contract (usually an interface). If you use this approach, you have no guarantee that the contract stays constant over time. Each time you change your Java contract and redeploy it, there might be subsequent changes to the web service contract.

Additionally, not all SOAP stacks generate the same web service contract from a Java contract. This means that changing your current SOAP stack for a different one (for whatever reason) might also change your web service contract.

When a web service contract changes, users of the contract have to be instructed to obtain the new contract and potentially change their code to accommodate for any changes in the contract.

For a contract to be useful, it must remain constant for as long as possible. If a contract changes, you have to contact all the users of your service and instruct them to get the new  version of the contract.

[[contract-first-performance]]
=== Performance

When a Java object is automatically transformed into XML, there is no way to be sure as to what is sent across the wire. An object might reference another object, which refers to another, and so on. In the end, half of  the objects on the heap in your virtual machine might be converted into XML, which results in slow response times.

When using contract-first, you explicitly describe what XML is sent where, thus making sure that it is exactly what you want.

[[contract-first-reusability]]
=== Reusability

Defining your schema in a separate file lets you reuse that file in different scenarios. Consider the definition of an `AirportCode` in a file called `airline.xsd`:

====
[source,xml]
----
<simpleType name="AirportCode">
    <restriction base="string">
        <pattern value="[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]"/>
    </restriction>
</simpleType>
----
====

You can reuse this definition in other schemas, or even WSDL files, by using an `import` statement.

[[contract-first-versioning]]
=== Versioning

Even though a contract must remain constant for as long as possible, they do need to be changed sometimes. In Java, this typically results in a new Java interface, such as  `AirlineService2`, and a (new) implementation of that interface. Of course, the old service must be kept around, because there might be clients who have not yet migrated.

If using contract-first, we can have a looser coupling between contract and implementation. Such a looser coupling lets us implement both versions of the contract in one class. We could, for  instance, use an XSLT stylesheet to convert any "`old-style`" messages to the "`new-style`" messages.
